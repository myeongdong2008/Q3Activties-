	<h3>Batman v Superman</h3>
	<p><b>Rating:</b> 8/10<br>The movie was good, there were a lot of action scenes and the cinematograpghy was dark and top-notch. But there were a lot of things happening in the movie, and Batman's reason to kill Superman should have been better.</p>
	</div><br></center>
 
	<center><div class="col-9">
	<h3>Captain America: Civil War</h3>
	<p><b>Rating:</b> 9/10<br>This movie was similar to BvS, as they made heroes fight each other.The story of the movie was better than BvS, the reason of them fighting each other was better and more valid. But they made some characters in the movie, weak or "nerfed" unlike BvS who showed both characters at their peak strength.</p>

	<h3>John Wick 3: Parabellum </h3>
	<p><b>Rating:</b> 9.5/10<br>This 3rd installment of the John Wick series was great, the action scenes were a lot and there were a lot of adventures. But the movie sticked to one plot, killing the other killers, which was great but could've explored one more plot to not be able to predict what can happen in the movie.</p><br>
